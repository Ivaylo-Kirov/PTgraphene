similar to how JS functions by associating objects with TYPES that graphene provides > seems like these types allow the GraphQL engine to treat these objects as required (i.e. ObjectType, Schema, String, Int) > then create a python class and variables and have resolve_variable methods to tell the engine what to return for those queries > schema.execute(query) to test it out

* Round 2 - added another item to RootQuery and noticed that after executing a query, the returned object is a dict (i.e. ['about', 'About what']) and so when you print you do print(result['about'])
